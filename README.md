# ReStore

A distributed key-value store for small, simple datasets.

It's still in development, so it's not on Hex yet.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `re_store` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:re_store, github: "schrockwell/re_store"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/re_store>.
